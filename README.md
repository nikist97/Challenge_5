# Extending the Bare Bones Interpreter from Challenge_4
What I've managed to add so far is an if statement, comments, assignments and basic operators. I've also included three examples illustrating how to use all of these.The example factorial.txt finds the factorial of a given number and the example prime.txt can verify if a number is prime. The syntax is really similar to the syntax of Python - that's why I call the language Bare Python.. I will try to add methods as well - still working on them... 
UPDATE: Managed to add very simple methods with a lot of assumptions.. - you can only have one return statement, which can't be in an if statement block or in a while loop block. The isItPrime.txt example verifies if a number is prime using a method.
